## 🤔 Why Two Versions?

Since deploying this full AI was tricky, here’s the scoop:

- 🖥️ The **Streamlit version** (all the .py files) does everything — including making pretty charts.
- 🌐 The **Langflow version**(Langflow.json) works great for info, summaries, and tables but can't generate chart type of things

## 🚀 How to Use

1. If you want to use in your langflow - upload this langflow.json file in your local langflow or in datastax langflow and put your api key.
2. Run it using 'run playground' option and Type in your query about MSME schemes, loans, or GST.
3. If you want to run via vs-code or pycharm just upload these files and run using streamlit.
4. You’ll get quick answers, summaries, charts and tables that help you make decisions faster.
